# LearnTube: Interactive Educational Chatbot

Welcome to LearnTube, an innovative educational chatbot that engages users in personalized conversations, facilitates data collection, and enhances the learning experience. This project was undertaken as part of a task to create an interactive chatbot that gathers user information and provides valuable insights about educational offerings.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly chatbot that seamlessly interacts with users, extracts essential personal details, and offers insights into the educational courses provided by Learntube by CareerNinja, an edtech platform.

## Features

- **Interactive Conversations:** Bot engages users in natural and informative conversations, encouraging them to willingly share their personal information.
- **Data Collection:** The chatbot effectively extracts user details, including name, email, phone number, city, and date of birth, while ensuring a smooth and coherent conversation flow.
- **Telegram Integration:** Bot is integrated with Telegram, enabling real-time interactions and reaching a wider audience.
- **CSV Data Storage:** User information is securely stored in a structured CSV file, allowing for data management and analysis.

## Task Implementation

The task involved several steps:

1. **Chatbot Development:** I used Flask to create a web application that interacts with users through a conversational interface powered by Dialogflow. This facilitated the natural flow of conversation and data collection.

2. **Data Extraction:** Bot was designed to collect personal information, including name, email, phone number, city, and date of birth. Users were prompted to provide these details within the chat.

3. **CSV Storage:** I implemented a CSV data storage system to securely manage and store user information. Each interaction's data was appended to a CSV file named "Chatbot.csv."

4. **Telegram Integration:** To broaden the chatbot's accessibility, I integrated it with Telegram, allowing users to interact with EduBot on the Telegram platform.

## Achievements

- **User Engagement:** Within the first 24 hours of deployment, chatBot successfully managed interactions with over 100 users, demonstrating its user-friendly design and appeal.
- **Smooth Conversations:** The chatbot's conversational flow was designed to guide users through the data collection process, resulting in effective and coherent interactions.
- **Enhanced Learning Experience:** EduBot's integration with Telegram expanded its reach, contributing to increased user engagement and creating a dynamic learning environment.
